It is mostly accurate although it does think one person is an airplane.  including the time to fetch images from the camera and dis- play the detections.  The resulting system is interactive and engaging. While YOLO processes images individually, when attached to a webcam it functions like a tracking system, detecting ob- jects as they move around and change in appearance. A demo of the system and the source code can be found on our project website: http://pjreddie.com/yolo/.  6. Conclusion  We introduce YOLO, a uniﬁed model for object detec- tion. Our model is simple to construct and can be trained  directly on full images. Unlike classiﬁer-based approaches, YOLO is trained on a loss function that directly corresponds to detection performance and the entire model is trained jointly.  Fast YOLO is the fastest general-purpose object detec- tor in the literature and YOLO pushes the state-of-the-art in real-time object detection. YOLO also generalizes well to new domains making it ideal for applications that rely on fast, robust object detection.
